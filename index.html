  <h1>Hi I'm Jimmy</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Oregon. I've lived in California for six years. I worked as a store manager for several years. I am married and we have a pug and turtle together. For hobbies I like to hike, read Marxist philosophy, and cook. I am looking to get into a field I've
  always been interested in: web programming.</p>
